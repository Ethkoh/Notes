x[2][:2]
x[2] results in a list, that you can subset again by adding additional square brackets.
A list can contain any Python type. But a list itself is also a Python type. That means that a list can also contain a list

A list can contain different types. eg int, float

copy of variable content using list() or using [:]

list to variable
variable=np.array(variable)

list vs numpy array
similar but array type is coercion but list can have different types
array 2d is same as list on lists
use of square and curve brackets are same
boolean works on array
calculation for array is different
subsetting and slicing are same

parameters vs arguments
when defining a function, paramters are written in function header
when call a function, pass arguments into function

index(), to get the index of the first element of a list that matches its input. Eg areas.index(20)
for array, just areas[20]

eg.
this is list on list:
baseball = [[180, 78.4],
            [215, 102.7],
            [210, 98.5],
            [188, 75.2]]
this creates a 2D numpy array from liston list
import numpy as np
np_baseball=np.array(baseball)

list can just + to add
