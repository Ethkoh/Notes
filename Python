#list vs numpy array
similar but array type is coercion but list can have different types
array 2d is same as list on lists
use of square and curve brackets are same
boolean works on array
calculation for array is different
subsetting and slicing are same

#parameters vs arguments
when defining a function, paramters are written in function header
when call a function, pass arguments into function
