1)Colour:

colour choices - primary colour should be more neutral.Any extended color should be used sparingly to draw attention to key messages within the data.

colour types - sequential,diverging,categorical etc

custom colour - palette: to suit company for sense of uniformity

consistency - make sure a color (e.g. red) does not mean three different things. Similar and repeated colors can imply a relation where one doesn’t exist

Accessibility — to account for color blindness in the design process.

2)Layout:

Newspaper or Z-layout — The most important content is put either at the top or the left of a visualization, as users move right and down for more specific content.

White space — Using negative space (blank spots) and padding to delineate sections of your visualization – don’t use thick “grid lines” as you would see in a table.

Size — More important pieces of content (KPIs, summary visualizations, etc.) should be larger than other items.

Device type — With device-specific dashboards you can create the optimum viewing experience on desktop, laptop, tablet, and phone.

3)Effective Title and Subtitle
You add more context with subtitles that describe how to interact with the worksheet or dashboard.

4) effective tooltip (for tableau)

5) typography

font level - clear hierarchy

size - Save your largest fonts for KPIs, titles, etc.

boldness

colour

6) dashboard interactivity
Skilled users know to click and experiment, but new users may not have the knowledge or confidence. Your job is to help them make these decisions consciously, not by accident.

7) Performance:

simple - easy to maintain in future. clear message to user
flexible - answer one or multiple questions. static or interactive report
fast -loading time

affected by visual design, calculations, queries, data connections, compatibility of hardware and software
