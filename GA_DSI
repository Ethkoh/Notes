feature engineering: Create columns derived from our data

What does a compelling data-driven presentation look like?
-Summarizing your findings.
-Labeling all plots and visualizations.
-Restating your hypothesis and initial assumptions.
-Describing your data and process.
-Explaining your model’s strengths and limitations.
-Providing an appropriate degree of disclosure for your audience (especially when dealing with proprietary data or sensitive user information).

range(x): 0 to x, not inclusive of x
range(a,b,c): a=start,b=stop,c=step

One way of vectorizing your data is called label encoding — assigning numerical values to each attribute.
Another common technique for vectorizing categorical data is called one-hot encoding (sometimes abbreviated as “OHE”).

The n points in an n-dimensional vector, x, each refer to the offset from nn orthogonal axes. 
We can define the magnitude of the vector x to be:∣∣x∣∣ = sqrt {(x_1^2 + x_2^2 + ... + x_n^2).
The magnitude is the square root of the sum of each component squared.

Normalizing a vector means that we’re mapping the vector to a point on the unit.
v^ = (v1,...,vn)/∣v∣=( v1/∣v∣,..., vn/∣v∣)


A unit circle in three dimensions is a unit sphere. In higher dimensions, it’s a unit hypersphere.
