feature engineering: Create columns derived from our data

What does a compelling data-driven presentation look like?
-Summarizing your findings.
-Labeling all plots and visualizations.
-Restating your hypothesis and initial assumptions.
-Describing your data and process.
-Explaining your model’s strengths and limitations.
-Providing an appropriate degree of disclosure for your audience (especially when dealing with proprietary data or sensitive user information).

range(x): 0 to x, not inclusive of x
range(a,b,c): a=start,b=stop,c=step

One way of vectorizing your data is called label encoding — assigning numerical values to each attribute.
Another common technique for vectorizing categorical data is called one-hot encoding (sometimes abbreviated as “OHE”).

The n points in an n-dimensional vector, x, each refer to the offset from nn orthogonal axes. 
We can define the magnitude of the vector x to be:∣∣x∣∣ = sqrt {(x_1^2 + x_2^2 + ... + x_n^2).
The magnitude is the square root of the sum of each component squared.

Normalizing a vector means that we’re mapping the vector to a point on the unit.
v^ = (v1,...,vn)/∣v∣=( v1/∣v∣,..., vn/∣v∣)

matrices are written as nested lists, just as you’d write them in NumPy. So, the first nested list is the first row.
 
This is a new way of thinking about matrices. Instead of just storing data points, we’re now using matrices to store systems of equations.A unit circle in three dimensions is a unit sphere. In higher dimensions, it’s a unit hypersphere.

to add: np.array
dot product: np.dot(x,y)

A set is a collection of unordered, unique elements.There are two approaches to use when creating a set:
-Curly braces
-Using the built-in set() function with an iterable as an argument
Taking advantage of sets means your program runs faster and uses less memory. If you don't have duplicates and you don't need order, use a set.

there are three types of probability:
Marginal probability: The likelihood of a single event occurring, independent of any other events happening before or after it.
Joint probability: The likelihood of two independent events happening together, where the occurrence of one does not affect the occurrence of the other.
Conditional probability: The likelihood of two events happening together, where the occurrence of one affects the occurrence of the other.

the equals sign (or, in Python speak, the assignment operator) assigns the value to each variable.

data types: numbers,none,boolean,strings,lists,tuples,sets,dictionaries

Lists are:
Ordered: Their elements have a particular order that will never change.
Heterogeneous: Different data types can be stored for each element in the list. For example, ['cat', 10, 0.4].
Mutable: When you alter a list, you don't create a new element — the original element is just modified.

pop() removes an element from a list. You can provide it the specific index to remove, or else it will default to removing the last element from the list.
append() adds an item to the end of a list.

tuples are similar to lists in that you can store multiple values. However, there's one huge difference:
Tuples are immutable — you can't alter a tuple element once it's been created.
Additionally, because tuples have fixed sizes (determined when they're assigned initial values), they're more memory-efficient than a list, which needs additional memory allocated to it.
To define a new tuple, use parentheses instead of brackets
Tuples are used for information that won't change: the days of the week

To check whether an element is in a set, we use the in operator.
Eg 'Riyadh' in my_places_traveled 
True

As with sets, a dictionary is defined using curly braces. 
However, each element of a dictionary consists of a key, followed by a colon, then by a value.

To create an empty set, use the built-in set() function (e.g., untasty_fruits = set()). Why? Because in Python, curly braces are used for both sets and dictionaries. Empty braces {} indicate an empty dictionary.

len() only count unique values in sets. list everything counted
