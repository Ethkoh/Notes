feature engineering: Create columns derived from our data

What does a compelling data-driven presentation look like?
-Summarizing your findings.
-Labeling all plots and visualizations.
-Restating your hypothesis and initial assumptions.
-Describing your data and process.
-Explaining your model’s strengths and limitations.
-Providing an appropriate degree of disclosure for your audience (especially when dealing with proprietary data or sensitive user information).

range(x): 0 to x, not inclusive of x
range(a,b,c): a=start,b=stop,c=step

One way of vectorizing your data is called label encoding — assigning numerical values to each attribute.
Another common technique for vectorizing categorical data is called one-hot encoding (sometimes abbreviated as “OHE”).

The n points in an n-dimensional vector, x, each refer to the offset from nn orthogonal axes. 
We can define the magnitude of the vector x to be:∣∣x∣∣ = sqrt {(x_1^2 + x_2^2 + ... + x_n^2).
The magnitude is the square root of the sum of each component squared.

Normalizing a vector means that we’re mapping the vector to a point on the unit.
v^ = (v1,...,vn)/∣v∣=( v1/∣v∣,..., vn/∣v∣)

 matrices are written as nested lists, just as you’d write them in NumPy. So, the first nested list is the first row.
 
This is a new way of thinking about matrices. Instead of just storing data points, we’re now using matrices to store systems of equations.A unit circle in three dimensions is a unit sphere. In higher dimensions, it’s a unit hypersphere.

to add: np.array
dot product: np.dot(x,y)

A set is a built-in data structure within Python. It’s an unordered collection of distinct hashable objects.
There are two approaches to use when creating a set:
-Curly braces
-Using the built-in set() function with an iterable as an argument

there are three types of probability:
Marginal probability: The likelihood of a single event occurring, independent of any other events happening before or after it.
Joint probability: The likelihood of two independent events happening together, where the occurrence of one does not affect the occurrence of the other.
Conditional probability: The likelihood of two events happening together, where the occurrence of one affects the occurrence of the other.

the equals sign (or, in Python speak, the assignment operator) assigns the value to each variable.
