MAE vs RMSE
RMSE if not much outliers or shocks. 

using other features such as day or time for time series?
day of week is bad. is 1 to 7 but 1 to 7 is suppose to be side by side.
day of year not too bad.
time is bad. think of angle around circle.
instead of using one number for cyclic data, think of using uv inputs (2 values).

Can you elaborate a little on how you normalize your timeseries? Are all values relative to T0 or would you use other baselines such as moving averages?
random boost or xgboost dont need normalize but very impt for neural network
why need normalize?
-saturation
-inputs need to be about same size. otherwise if take dotproduct will dorminate other numbers

neural network tip
-difference network: add y(T+0) to output.
why? beats persistence, no need detrending, spikes are ok
-momentum and force inputs.
first and second order differences of all inputs as new input 
-input scaling subnet 
symmetric squashing function (tanh)
-dimension reduction subnet
NN dont work well with large dimensional inputs(>100). reduce dimensions using dim reduction/compression
-squared inputs
have properties of both perceptrons and rbf neurons
